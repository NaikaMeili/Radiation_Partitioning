# Radiation_Partitioning
This is the radiation partitioning code to partition total incoming solar shortwave radiation into its direct and diffuse parts as needed as model input in Urban Tethys-Chloris (UT&C) (Meili et al. 2020, GMD).

The radiation partitioning code is developed by Prof. Dr. Simone Fatichi and based on the following publication:

Fatichi, S., Ivanov, V. Y., Caporali, E., 2011, Simulation of future climate scenarios with a weather generator, Advances in Water Resources, 34, 4, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2010.12.013.

A video tutorial on how to run the code can be found on youtube:
